      "a": "Yes, during the time when the ego-car was slowing down and stopping because of congestion, there were several adjustments made to the car's direction.

      "q": "As a passenger, would I have felt any kind of car speed changes?",
      "a": "As far as the drive went, the speed experienced would have been gentle with regular changes. The car started off at a moderate pace and then the speed decreased a little at the beginning of the drive, but started picking up pace after the turn and maintained  a good speed for most of the drive.

      "q": "Can you clarify more about the steering movements during this whole drive?",
      "a": "Sure. At the beginning, there was relatively sharp movement to the right for making the turn, the car then took a steeper turn to complete the right. After the right turn, the car gradually calmed down and steered less acutely. The car retained a straightforward path then took a gentle turn to the left. After this, the car maintained a more steady and aligned steering with very small movements, marking its path in the left lane. Towards the end of the drive, there were subtle steering movements, nothing too steep."

      "a": "Our speed varied throughout the journey. We started off at a relatively modest pace. When we approached the sign and the crossing vehicle, we needed to stop, so our speed dropped to zero for a bit. Once the road cleared, we gradually picked up speed. Especially after the right and left turns, our speed increased significantly as we moved down the street. But it is to be noted that all these speed changes were conducted keeping road safety and regulations in mind. \n    \nQuestion: Was the overall journey smooth or were there any abrupt turns?\nAnswer: The journey involved some degrees of turns. We initially had to turn the wheel quite a bit to stop for the sign and the crossing vehicle. Afterward, a noticeable turn was needed for performing the right turn and proceeding down the street. The left turn at the crosswalk also involved a significant wheel turn in the opposite direction. Despite these, turns were executed smoothly considering the circumstances."

    "QA": {
      "q": "What triggered the car's decision to change lanes and subsequently stop?",
      "a": "The car's maneuver was mainly influenced by traffic light signals. The change of lanes to the left was the car's initial movement towards the intended stop. When the traffic light turned red, which was around the 2nd second, the car preparation to stop began, and it was eventually halted for the duration of the red light."

      "q": "Can you predict the motive behind the car's movement towards the left?",
      "a": "Precisely predicting the motive isn't possible, however, it is typically associated with an intention to either take a turn or to switch to a faster lane. In this instance, since the car eventually stopped, it's fairly possible that a turn or an intersection was upcoming."

      "a": "Certainly. When the car sees the stop sign, it starts to slow down almost instantly. For the next few seconds, it's reducing speed until it halts completely. It stays stationary for a bit, then starts moving off slowly. It takes a few seconds for it to gain some momentum, and then you notice a significant increase in speed as it executes a right-turn maneuver."

    "QA": {
      "q": "How can the vehicle cross safely when another vehicle crosses the road?",
      "a": "That's a challenging question, as the movement depends on the actions of the other vehicle. If the crossing vehicle has already passed or is far enough while our vehicle is turning right, it would not affect our journey. However, if the other vehicle is close, our vehicle may need to wait until it's safe to continue. The exact situation is not specified here."

Around the mid-point, we had to slow down because of the changing traffic light but then picked up speed again afterwards.

It initially angled a little to the right but then a pronounced turn to the left when the driver made the lane change. The wheel was then straightened out before angling slightly to the left again, presumably in preparation for the left-hand turn.
