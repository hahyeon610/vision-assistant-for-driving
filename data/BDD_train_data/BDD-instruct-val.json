The pedestrian appeared on the scene after about 4 seconds into the parking maneuver."}}, {"video_id": "0339a42b-1e75ac9a.mov", "QA": {"q": "Once we parked, how did the scene change in terms of vehicle count and type in the vicinity?", "a": "Once the car was parked, the scenario did change quite significantly. Along with a few cars, a new entity, a bus, also appeared in view. There were a few more vehicles near the ego-car than there were when we first started parking but none posed an immediate threat due to distance."}}, {"video_id": "0339a42b-1e75ac9a.mov", "QA": {"q": "What kind of situation would it be if another car was moving toward our parking spot while we were trying to park?", "a": "If another car was moving towards our parking spot while we were trying to park, it could have created a potentially unsafe situation. Depending on the speed and proximity of the other car, the driver might have had to pause or alter the parking maneuver. This could have resulted in the need for additional adjustments to ensure proper positioning in the parking spot. It would certainly require careful attention and alertness on part of the driver."}}, {"video_id": "06ea71d8-6f0a4db0.mov", "QA": {"q": "How did the surroundings look like initially when we started our drive?", "a": "Initially, our journey started smoothly with no obstructions ahead, offering a clear path for our ego-car to travel down the road comfortably.\n    \nQuestion: What was our first major maneuver on the road?\nAnswer: The first significant action was when our ego-car merged into the left lane from the current lane, intending to transition to a parallel street."}}, {"video_id": "06ea71d8-6f0a4db0.mov", "QA": {"q": "What exactly happened after we moved to the parallel street?", "a": "After moving to the parallel street, our ego-car then proceeded to merge into the center lane of this new street we've transitioned onto."}}, {"video_id": "06ea71d8-6f0a4db0.mov", "QA": {"q": "What difficulty did the car face while merging into the leftmost lane?", "a": "Our ego-car had to wait for another vehicle to pass before it could successfully merge into the leftmost lane. This presented a brief pause in our movement."}}, {"video_id": "06ea71d8-6f0a4db0.mov", "QA": {"q": "What was the direction we were headed towards after this?", "a": "After the leftmost lane merge, our ego-car strategically moved into a left turn lane, indicating that we were moving towards an intersection next."}}, {"video_id": "06ea71d8-6f0a4db0.mov", "QA": {"q": "How did our car respond as we approached the intersection?", "a": "As our ego-car moved down the turn lane and got closer to the intersection, it started slowing down and eventually came to a stop because the traffic light had turned red."}}, {"video_id": "06ea71d8-6f0a4db0.mov", "QA": {"q": "What could we potentially anticipate the driver might have done if the light hadn't turned red?", "a": "If the light hadn't turned red, it's reasonable to infer that our driver might have continued to drive through the intersection without stopping. However, due to traffic regulations, the driver had to stop the car at the red light to ensure safety."}}, {"video_id": "06ec79fd-ad0188f8.mov", "QA": {"q": "How did the ego-car transition from being parked to getting into the traffic lane?", "a": "The ego-car first moved to the left to leave the parking spot and enter the lane. It slowed down briefly to allow another vehicle to pass then finally merged fully into the lane. "}}, {"video_id": "06ec79fd-ad0188f8.mov", "QA": {"q": "What influenced the vehicle's decision to slow its acceleration while merging?", "a": "The vehicle slowed its acceleration to let a car moving in the lane it was entering to pass.

Stopping at a red light is a vital traffic regulation all drivers need to adhere to."}}, {"video_id": "06ec79fd-ad0188f8.mov", "QA": {"q": "What could have potentially happened if the car didn't slow down to let the other car pass while merging?", "a": "If the ego-car hadn't slowed down to let the other car pass, there might have been a collision or at least a frightening near miss. Not yielding to traffic in the lane could create a dangerous situation."}}, {"video_id": "0010bf16-a457685b.mov", "QA": {"q": "Can you describe how the traffic was when the car was stationary at the red light?", "a": "When we were stopped because of the red light, there were multiple vehicles in our vicinity. There was a bus and another car positioned ahead of our car and two cars on the side."}}, {"video_id": "0010bf16-a457685b.mov", "QA": {"q": "How did the position of the other objects change once we started moving?", "a": "Once the light turned green and our car started progressing, all vehicles also advanced. The car and bus that were ahead of us moved further forward, indicating they were also driving. Meanwhile, two additional cars appeared in our view, one slightly ahead and another at the side."}}, {"video_id": "0010bf16-a457685b.mov", "QA": {"q": "How did the bus's position compare to the other cars' positions when we began to move?", "a": "The bus remained in a forward position relative to our car, further than the other cars around.

The ego-car could have been approaching an intersection or a sharp turn, so keeping a slower speed is a suitable driving move. Without specific context like signs or traffic signals, it's hard to pinpoint an exact reason."}}, {"video_id": "06fb4e9c-42c4177c.mov", "QA": {"q": "What could've happened if our car didn't stop when the cars ahead were stopped?", "a": "Since our ego-car decided to halt to not block the cross traffic, if we didn't stop, it would have potentially blocked the road, making it difficult for the cross traffic to move forward. This could lead to a possible traffic violation or worse, an accident."}}, {"video_id": "06fb4e9c-42c4177c.mov", "QA": {"q": "Given the fact that our car had to wait because vehicles in front were stationary, can you speculate about the traffic situation?", "a": "It's plausible to assume that there might be heavy traffic, an accident or perhaps a red traffic signal ahead causing the cars to stop. "}}, {"video_id": "06fb4e9c-42c4177c.mov", "QA": {"q": "If the situations ahead got cleared up sooner, how could we have proceeded differently?", "a": "If the halt from the cars ahead were cleared up sooner, we would have continued our path without interruption. This would have allowed us to navigate through the cross street faster without having to briefly wait."}}, {"video_id": "06fb4e9c-42c4177c.mov", "QA": {"q": "What is the potential next action, given that we're stationary because the cars ahead have stopped?", "a": "The most probable next course of action would be to wait until the cars ahead start moving again.

As our ego-car slowed down due to the red light, it seems like the other cars and truck also adjusted their positions. By the time our car came to a full stop, one car had moved farther away, while the others remained in close proximity. Additionally, two pedestrians became visible."}}, {"video_id": "01f5086d-7820a48d.mov", "QA": {"q": "During our drive, was there any immediate threat or obstacle in front of our car as we were stopping?", "a": "No, there weren't any immediate obstacles or direct threats in front of our ego-car. The traffic flow was normal and the ego-car was merely obeying the traffic light by slowing down."}}, {"video_id": "01f5086d-7820a48d.mov", "QA": {"q": "As the ego-car stayed halted, what are the changes observed in the vicinity?", "a": "As our ego-car remained at a standstill, one of the nearby cars managed to distance itself further from our car, while two pedestrians entered the scene."}}, {"video_id": "01f5086d-7820a48d.mov", "QA": {"q": "If the pedestrians were to cross the road, would our car be in a position to move immediately after the light turns green?", "a": "Based on the given data, it appears the pedestrians are not directly in front of our vehicle. However, it's pivotal to wait until the pedestrians fully cross the road for safety reasons. Once they are clear, our ego-car should be free to move when the light turns green."}}, {"video_id": "01f5086d-7820a48d.mov", "QA": {"q": "What do you anticipate the driver would do if one of the pedestrians suddenly moved towards our car?", "a": "If a pedestrian unexpectedly moved towards our ego-car, the driver would likely remain stationary even if the light turned green, prioritizing the pedestrian's safety."}}, {"video_id": "038db692-9c25743b.mov", "QA": {"q": "What happened at the traffic light and how did the ego-car react?", "a": "The traffic light turned green, and the ego-car responded by making a left turn."}}, {"video_id": "038db692-9c25743b.mov", "QA": {"q": "What could have been the possible actions for the ego-car if the road wasn't free of traffic after the turn?", "a": "If the road wasn't free of traffic after the turn, the ego-car might have needed to slow down or stop depending on the proximity and speed of other vehicles or pedestrians. Alternatively, the ego-car might have had to change lanes if it were safe and permissible to do so."}}, {"video_id": "038db692-9c25743b.mov", "QA": {"q": "What would the ego-car's reaction to encountering a red light instead of a green one?", "a": "If the traffic light had been red instead of green, the ego-car would have most likely come to a stop to conform to traffic rules and to ensure safety."}}, {"video_id": "038db692-9c25743b.mov", "QA": {"q": "If the traffic wasn't free, could the ego-car have continued to drive forward without any change in its actions?", "a": "Depending on the distance and speed of the other vehicles, the ego-car might have had to adjust its speed or change lanes to continue forward safely. If the traffic was too heavy, it could have been forced to slow down or even stop."}}, {"video_id": "02065c11-194478e8.mov", "QA": {"q": "The car seems to have maintained a slow speed initially and then slowed down even more. Can you guess why the driver might have done that?", "a": "Based on the observed situations, the driver might have been wary of surrounding vehicles. Intermittent presence of different cars around our ego-car suggests high traffic or continual change in traffic conditions, which might require cautious driving at a slower pace. "}}, {"video_id": "02065c11-194478e8.mov", "QA": {"q": "Were there any specific traffic conditions that might have induced the driver to change the car's speed after the initial slow down?", "a": "Yes, there was a bump on the road which was likely the cause of the increase in speed afterwards. The driver probably wanted to maintain momentum while overcoming the bump."}}, {"video_id": "02065c11-194478e8.mov", "QA": {"q": "Can you predict what might have happened if the driver hadn't slowed down given the earlier described traffic conditions?", "a": "Without specifics, it's tough to say, but generally higher speed in dense traffic or constantly changing road conditions increases the risk of collision."}}, {"video_id": "02065c11-194478e8.mov", "QA": {"q": "Why the driver stayed at the slow speed even after getting past the bump?", "a": "The driver must still see the need to keep a controlled speed due to dense traffic condition or the continuous presence and change of other cars. "}}, {"video_id": "02065c11-194478e8.mov", "QA": {"q": "Was there any particular vehicle that stayed around our ego-car throughout?", "a": "It is not clearly stated but the descriptions suggest that no specific car remained in proximity to our ego-car throughout the time period described."}}, {"video_id": "02065c11-194478e8.mov", "QA": {"q": "Would driving speed remain the same if the traffic condition changed?", "a": "It's subjective to the driver, but usually, if traffic conditions improve, meaning less density or less change in vehicles around, drivers might increase their speed while still considering the speed limits and safety. "}}, {"video_id": "02065c11-194478e8.mov", "QA": {"q": "After passing the bump, what were other potential reasons that might make the driver maintain the slow speed?", "a": "Given the information, it appears that despite passing the bump, there were multiple cars in relatively close proximity to our ego-car. The driver was likely being cautious of these other vehicles, which may have influenced the decision to maintain a slow speed."}}, {"video_id": "06ff7d61-53ba5061.mov", "QA": {"q": "How did the ego-car react when approaching the intersection?", "a": "The ego-car prepared for the intersection by merging to the left lane and slightly slowed down before making a left turn through the intersection."}}, {"video_id": "06ff7d61-53ba5061.mov", "QA": {"q": "Why do you think the ego-car slowed down before the intersection?", "a": "It's generally a good and safe practice to slow down before making a turn. This allows the driver to have better control over the vehicle and gives them enough time to react if something unexpected were to occur."}}, {"video_id": "06ff7d61-53ba5061.mov", "QA": {"q": "Was there any sign of obstacles or other cars ahead while the ego-car was traveling and turning left?", "a": "No, from the observed situation, there was no mention of any obstructions on the road ahead while our vehicle was traveling, and even while making the left turn."}}, {"video_id": "06ff7d61-53ba5061.mov", "QA": {"q": "If there was another car approaching rapidly from the opposite direction while the ego-car was turning left, how might it have influenced the situation?", "a": "If another vehicle was approaching rapidly from the opposite direction while the ego-car was turning left, it could have made the situation unsafe.

First, it was stationary due to a red light. After that, the vehicle moved off, making a right turn, and then veered to the left to navigate around a stationary vehicle. Obeying the traffic rules, it slowed to a rolling stop at a stop sign, then accelerated to make another right turn. The vehicle slowed down to safely maneuver around another vehicle partially obstructing the lane.
