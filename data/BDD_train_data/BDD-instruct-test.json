How should that driver have ideally reacted?", "a": "Ideally, the driver of the car behind us should also react promptly to our car's actions.

How should that driver have ideally reacted?", "a": "Ideally, the driver of the car behind us should also react promptly to our car's actions.

In general, cars tend to slow down and prepare to stop when they see a yellow light. In this case, a dry weather condition may impact the car's braking performance positively, making the stopping process safer and quicker."}}, {"video_id": "043026cb-f72901db.mov", "QA": {"q": "Suppose, suddenly a pedestrian crossed the road when the light was green, how would the car have reacted?", "a": "In the event of a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road, the autonomous response system of our ego-car would initiate an immediate slow-down or stopping process to avoid an accident, despite the green light."}}, {"video_id": "043026cb-f72901db.mov", "QA": {"q": "In a different scenario, if the light had turned green while our car was stopped, what might have been the next action?", "a": "If the light had turned green whilst our car was stationary, our ego-car would have resumed moving forward while maintaining reasonable acceleration for safety."}}, {"video_id": "0432d284-c924667e.mov", "QA": {"q": "How did the encontered situations influence the speed and maneuvering of our car during the drive?", "a": "Initially, our car smoothly made a left turn, following a slow-moving vehicle upfront. Later, a slow car in our lane caused us to switch to the right lane. We had to proceed cautiously for some time as there were vehicles on both sides of us, and one even merged into our lane. After that, we were able to drive smoothly as our lane was free of any traffic. We briefly decreased our speed to accommodate a speed bump and continued to drive in a lane with no traffic around us.

Lane changes could also be more frequent depending on the speed of the cars around us. The overall journey time would likely increase due to lower average speed and more frequent stops or slowdowns."}}, {"video_id": "0432d284-c924667e.mov", "QA": {"q": "How could the presence of a pedestrian crossing the street between 00:30 and 00:32 have affected the driving?", "a": "If there was a pedestrian crossing the street during the period of 00:30 and 00:32, our car would further reduce the speed or even come to a complete stop to allow the pedestrian to safely cross, respecting traffic rules and ensuring safety for the pedestrian.

Was there influence of the pedestrian movement?", "a": "The car changed lanes because the lane to the left was flowing faster than its current lane.

However, generally, if it's safe and legal to do so, the driver might consider changing lanes to keep moving."}}, {"video_id": "15569b20-19c2fc7a.mov", "QA": {"q": "What is the reason behind the fluctuation in the ego-car's speed within the short period of time?", "a": "The ego-car's speed depends on the traffic situation. Initially, it moves slowly because traffic is starting to flow. Then, it accelerates as traffic picks up speed when the traffic signal turns green.

What might have triggered a change in the driver's behavior?", "a": "Upon seeing the emergency lights, the driver probably inferred that something out of the ordinary had occurred further up the road.

In residential areas, it maintains a steady speed, indicative of adherence to speed limits. It prioritizes pedestrian safety, coming to a complete stop at a crossing guard and waiting until the pedestrians have safely crossed.

This might include moving out of the way of an approaching vehicle or moving forward when a parking place becomes available. However, since the vehicle is still stationary, many of the circumstances would remain unchanged."}}, {"video_id": "19906a63-3976be3a.mov", "QA": {"q": "Why did our car need to switch lanes so frequently?", "a": "It was necessary to maintain a safe and efficient cruise through the traffic. Initially, the car was getting too close to us, necessitating a shift to the left lane. Afterwards, a bus in our lane was turning slowly, so we moved to the middle lane to avoid it.

Also, the driver of the ego-car could be penalized for violating traffic rules."}}, {"video_id": "1aa6dd36-6a185586.mov", "QA": {"q": "How would traffic flow change if the roads were not clear?", "a": "If the roads were not clear, possibly due to heavy traffic or obstructions, the ego-car would have had to either slow down, stop more frequently, or take a different route to the destination. Additionally, it might have also required the driver to exhibit more caution and follow defensive driving mechanisms."}}, {"video_id": "1aa6dd36-6a185586.mov", "QA": {"q": "What if there were more stop signs on the road, would it affect the speed of the drive?", "a": "More stop signs would indeed affect the speed of the drive.
